# Sepsis Predictor 🧬

A machine learning-based project to predict the onset of **sepsis** using patient medical data. Early detection of sepsis can significantly improve outcomes by enabling timely intervention.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's extreme response to infection. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient vitals and lab measurements, predicting the likelihood of sepsis development.

## 🔍 Features

- Preprocessing of patient medical records
- Model training and evaluation
- Binary classification: Sepsis or Non-Sepsis
- Visualizations and metrics for model performance

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy, Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model**: Random Forest / XGBoost (or whichever you used)

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KevinPatrickSS/sepsis_predictor.git
   cd sepsis_predictor
